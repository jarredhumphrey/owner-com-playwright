# Owner.com Example Playwright Code

## What is included?

These sample tests contain a few navigation tests regarding the top banner, as well as a test that fills out the "request a demo" form. The form test notably does not submit the form, so as to refrain from flooding your inbox with test data.

## Running the Tests

You can run the Playwright tests I have made by using the command `npx playwright test`.

## Why write these sample tests?

I have found that with the advent of generative AI, that it is really hard to be seen by normal methods. I can only imagine the sheer volume of resumes that hiring managers and recruiters have to read nowadays, and I felt like this was the best way to stand out. Also, writing test automation is my favorite part of my career, so it's always fun to play around in test frameworks.overed in end-to-end tests.
